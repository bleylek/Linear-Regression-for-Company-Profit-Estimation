Company Profit Estimation with Linear Regression

This repository hosts a dataset of 1000 companies, including various financial metrics, and a Jupyter notebook that implements a Linear Regression model to estimate company profits based on those metrics. The primary aim is to provide a tool for financial analysis and prediction that can be utilized by data scientists, financial analysts, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the correlation between company financials and their profit outcomes.

Overview:
The 1000_Companies.csv file contains financial data of 1000 companies, featuring metrics such as R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, and Profit. The Linear_Regression_for_Company_Profit_Estimation.ipynb Jupyter notebook utilizes this dataset to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model that predicts company profits based on the provided metrics.

Technologies Used:
This project makes extensive use of the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning model implementation.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is used here for dataset preprocessing and analysis.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Scikit-learn: A Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is used here for implementing the Linear Regression model and evaluating its performance.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: These Python libraries are used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
